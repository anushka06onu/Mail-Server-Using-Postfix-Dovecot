# Mail Server Using Postfix and Dovecot

## Project Overview
This project implements a Linux-based mail server using Postfix (SMTP),
Dovecot (IMAP/POP3), OpenDKIM, and Roundcube Webmail. The system is deployed
on a VPS with proper DNS and email authentication mechanisms.

## Technologies Used
- Linux (Ubuntu)
- Postfix
- Dovecot
- OpenDKIM
- Apache
- PHP
- MariaDB
- Roundcube
- DNS (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)

## Features
- Secure email sending and receiving
- Web-based email access
- Email authentication and anti-spoofing
- Real-world deliverability testing

## Notes
Due to the use of a free domain, some emails may be classified as spam
despite correct SPF/DKIM/DMARC configuration.
